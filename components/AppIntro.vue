        Career laddering is a system used to show what expectations are at
        different levels of a role, a purpose of which can be defining how one
        might be promoted. I’ve personally found being transparent about
        expectations helpful as an Engineering Leader, but is only one
        supportive piece of a whole. It’s critical that career laddering docs
        are just one tool embedded in a deeper process.

        It’s not important for an Engineering Leader to use my process. It is,
        however,
        <span class="italic">very important</span> that an Engineering Manager
        is clear with their employees about expectations and direction.

        Roles up to and including Senior, ladders are constructed around
        becoming the best at what one does that one might personally be.

        At Staff level, the career expands to help others be successful with
        what you do and know, and scale yourself.

      <p>
        At Principal and beyond, you are trying to help others be the best that
        they can be, removing yourself and meeting others where they are.
